## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

For 19 years, I've developed my career working with numbers, processes, and people. I worked for three years in external audit at PwC, where I reviewed over 60 large companies in sectors like banking, industry, and healthcare. After that, I worked on SOx/ITGC internal controls at the largest retail group in Brazil: I reviewed all IT controls and found problems before the external auditors did. I also co-founded and ran a business for seven years, where I managed operations, finance, and a team of up to 14 people, serving over 200 clients.

This experience gave me something unusual: I know both the auditor's view and the manager's view. I know where risks hide because I've looked for them as an auditor, and I understand why processes fail because I've been the person responsible for making them work. I have Spanish citizenship and I'm now looking to return to the corporate world in Europe, in audit, internal controls, or corporate finance roles.
